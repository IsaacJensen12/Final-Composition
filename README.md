# Final-Composition-Final
 
For this final composition my goals were trying to create a composition which worked together sonically and which had obvious representations on the visual side. My sonic aspects tended towards being more EDM and dancey, with a powerful kick and bass playing throughout most of the song. Along with this, the other drums add much needed rhythm along with the clap providing another hard hitting aspect to the song. The arpeggio addendum ambient and light effect to the piece which up to this point has mostly been this kick and bass. Finally the chords bring it all together in the post chorus, and for the last chorus of the song. The visual elements which are most obvious are the particles. Meant to mimic (to a degree) real splashes in the water, the splashes were assigned to each part of the drum. Along with this the arpeggio spun the cylinder around rapidly when it started playing. One of the less obvious aspects would have to be the water speed which is directly affected by the pitch of the bass. This speed gives almost a shake-like effect when the bass changes to higher pitches. Overall, I think the composition lived up to some of my goals set earlier in composition 2. I do think that if I was given more time, especially with the visual side, more of my vision for the composition could have been realized, however I am happy with where it ended up.
